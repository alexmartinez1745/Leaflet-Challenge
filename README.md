# Visualizing Data with Leaflet

## Background

Welcome to the United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short! The USGS is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes. As a new hire, you will be helping them out with an exciting new project!

The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. Their hope is that being able to visualize their data will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding..) on issues facing our planet.

## Steps Taken

### Visualization

1. **Get data set**

   The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes. 
   Gathered data from: [USGS GeoJSON Feed](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) page and selected the dataset 'All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days'. Used this URL endpoint (JSON format) to pull in the data for the visualization.


2. **Import & Visualize the Data**

   Created a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from the data set based on their longitude and latitude.

   * The data markers on the map reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and depth of the earth quake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and earthquakes with greater depth appear darker in color.

   * Bind popups: when a marker is clicked, additional information is presented.

   * Added a legend that provides context for the map data.
